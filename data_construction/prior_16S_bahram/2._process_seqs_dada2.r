#Processing Bahram sequence data.
#dada2 tutorial here: https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html
#NOTE: this is definitely a job for the cluster. Get a node with as much RAM and as many cores as you can.
#pair ends, quality filter, generate ESV tables using dada2. You will need the cluster for (1) memory and (2) parallel computing.
#remove junk seqs using the positive and negative controls.
#assign taxonomy to ESVs using RDP via dada2.
#save ESV (otu) and taxonomy tables. Make sure you can link these to mapping file of environmental data.
#you may need to trim primers off fastq files first. This seems useful: http://web.mit.edu/~r/current/arch/i386_linux26/lib/R/library/Biostrings/html/trimLRPatterns.html

#### quality filtering and trucantion. ####
#We're going to perform some quality filtering and truncation to clip off the parts of the reads where the uality scores get gnarly.
#Colin wishes there was an algorithm to decide this, rather than just eyeballing it.
#If Zoey is reading this in the future, she should create this algorithm and call it as a function!
#Just find where median line crosses some threshold on average or minimum for a bunch of samples, then use that.

#You can get buy on doing this with like two samples. Its just a visual check.
#quality scores will drop off at the end of the read. This will happen sooner for reverse reads.
